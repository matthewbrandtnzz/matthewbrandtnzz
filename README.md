### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Matthew and I'm part of the Data Team at [NZZ](https://www.nzz.ch "Neue ZÃ¼rcher Zeitung").

I fall into a self-titled category called the "Full-Stack Analyst" and have experience across a range of topics:
- Requirements Engineering & Business Analysis
- AGILE methodology and principles (Scrum, Kanban, etc.)
- Analytics tools like Mixpanel, Heap Analytics, Google Analytics, Piwik/Matomo, Adobe Analytics, Webtrends
- Tag Management Systems (TMS) like Google Tag Manager, Ensighten, Tealium iQ
- Frontend technologies (React, Vue, etc.)
- Programming languages (HTML5/CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, RegEx)
- SQL queries (mostly PostgreSQL, BigQuery and MySQL flavours)
- BigQuery / Google Cloud Storage understanding
- Database architecture and design (schemas, primary/-foreign keys, etc.)

In general, I have high tech-literacy and a service mindset. I will do anything to please my customers, whether they are internal employees or end-users of the platform I am working on!

âš¡ Fun fact: I have only lived in countries with ðŸŸ¥red and â¬œwhite flags. Can you guess which ones?
